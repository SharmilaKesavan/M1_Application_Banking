### Process

##### Understand the Customer Journey:
- Documenting customer touch points during processes such as account opening, loan origination and fraud reporting can help the bank improve customer experience based on specific data and anecdotes.

##### Identify Automation Candidates:
- Detailed flow chart documentation for high volume transactional processes such as loan application data entry, billing and wire processing can help identify specific steps that can benefit from automation. Flow charts, if created properly, will also capture the keystroke-level detail required to automate the work at scale.

##### Improve Compliance & Reduce Risk:
- Human error in processes such as know your customer (KYC) and credit review cause more than re-work – they can expose the bank to regulatory and financial risk. Documenting error root causes and removing needless variation from these processes can help standardize the work and mitigate possible risk.
